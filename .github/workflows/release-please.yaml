# Release Please pipeline
# Refreshes a pull request that updates the changelog & bumps the Semantic Version every
# time the `main` branch is merged to.
# N.B. conventional commits (as enforced by the relevant git hook) are a prerequisite for
# Release Please to generate changelogs and calculate new SemVer tags.
