## Prerequisites

To use `{{project_name}}` the following must be available locally:

- [Python {{python_version}}](https://docs.python.org/{{python_version}}/) or above
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Develop

Install the package in editable mode and run the entrypoint:

```sh
# run from the repository's root directory
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
uv run python -m {{project_name}}.main
```

IPython is available as the default shell. Start an interactive session with:

```sh
uv run ipython
```

### pycliche

`{{project_name}}` has been generated using the [pycliche](https://github.com/albertomh/pycliche)
project template.

To update `{{project_name}}` to a newer version of `pycliche`:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/{{project_name}}/
uvx copier update --skip-answered --trust [--vcs-ref=<TAG>]
```

If the `--vcs-ref` flag is not specified, `copier` will use the latest `pycliche` tag.

### Git principles

This repo follows trunk-based development. This means:

- the `main` branch should always be in a releasable state
- use short-lived feature branches

### Development prerequisites

In addition to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you will need the following to
develop `{{project_name}}`:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Dependency management

Dependencies are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, with exact versions captured by a
`uv.lock` lockfile. `uv` is used to manage dependencies:

```sh
# add a dependency to the project
uv add some-package
```

{%if is_github_project%}
Dependabot is configured to run weekly and update Python packages (minor & patch) and
GitHub Actions. See [.github/dependabot.yaml](.github/dependabot.yaml).

{%endif%}
### Logging

`{{project_name}}` uses [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) for structured logging.
The logging configuration is defined in `logging.py`. Use the `configure_logging` function
to set up logging when the application starts:

```python
import structlog

from {{project_name}}.logging import configure_logging

configure_logging()

logger = structlog.get_logger()
logger.info("{{project_name}} running", key="value")
```

### Style

Code style is enforced by pre-commit hooks. Linter rules are configured in the `ruff`
tables in `pyproject.toml`.

```sh
# before you start developing, install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Docstrings should follow the conventions set out in the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
guidelines when writing commit messages. `commitlint` is enabled as a pre-commit hook.
Valid commit types are defined in `.commitlintrc.ts`.

## Test

`pytest` and `coverage` are defined as test dependencies.

Run all tests and report on code coverage:

```sh
nox
```

Pass flags as you normally would to pytest eg.

```sh
nox -- -k some_keyword_expression
```

Tests can have marks, allowing you to run only a subset:

```sh
nox -- -m unit
# or
nox -- -m "not smoke"
```

See the `tool.pytest.ini_options` table in `pyproject.toml` for a list of all marks.

Nox is used to automate testing across different Python versions. Test sessions are
configured via `noxfile.py`. `coverage` reporting will only run for test runs for the
oldest and latest Python versions.

{%if is_github_project%}
## Tests in GitHub Actions

A matrix strategy is used for the `test` GitHub Action. This runs each Nox session
(i.e. Python version test run) as a separate pipeline job.

## Release

[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) is used to automate:

- Updating the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- Calculating the new SemVer tag based on conventional commit types.
- Creating a new GitHub release.

Release Please is configured as a GitHub action ([release-please.yaml](.github/workflows/release-please.yaml)).
It keeps a release pull request open that is refreshed as changes are merged into `main`.
To cut a release, simply merge the release pull request.

### GitHub Personal Access Token

In order for Release Please to automate the above process, a GitHub Actions secret called
`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` must exist in GitHub (under {{project_name}}/settings/secrets/actions).
The contents of this secret must be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:

```text
contents: write
pull-requests: write
```

For more information, consult the [release-please-action project](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action).
